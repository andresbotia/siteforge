# SiteForge Handoff

For the next session. Milestone 7 Preview Deployments + Tracking is LOCAL/CHECKPOINTED but NOT COMPLETE. The implementation exists in code, but hosted Supabase migration approval, migration application, hosted smoke testing, and production validation remain pending.

## Project

- SiteForge: AI-assisted local-business website operations
- Next.js App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind
- Supabase with server-only `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`, RLS on, and no anon/authenticated table grants
- Vercel production admin app deployment
- Temporary single-admin cookie auth (`SITEFORGE_ADMIN_*`)
- xAI provider infrastructure exists; live inference remains disabled (`XAI_ALLOW_LIVE_INFERENCE` not `true`)

Repo: `https://github.com/andresbotia/siteforge`
Branch: `main`

## Milestone 7 Summary

- Adds migration `20260830000000_preview_deployments_tracking.sql`
- New tables: `preview_deployments`, `preview_events`
- RLS enabled and `anon` / `authenticated` / `public` grants revoked
- Public preview publishing requires explicit `website_deployment` approval
- Approval execution mints a one-time visible `sfp_` token; only SHA-256 hash and token hint are stored
- Public route `/p/[token]` renders trusted Builder specs without admin chrome
- Invalid, expired, revoked, or missing-token previews return 404
- `/api/preview-events` accepts bounded beacon events and returns 204 without leaking token validity
- View and CTA events classify likely humans, bots, browser, and device
- Visitor keys are preview-scoped and daily rotating; raw IP is not stored
- Admin website detail shows preview status, token hint, analytics, request approval, and revoke controls
- Internal preview `/websites/[id]/preview` remains authenticated
- TypeScript passed: `npx tsc --noEmit`
- Lint passed: `npm run lint`
- Tests passed: 134
- Production build passed: `npm run build`
- No production deployment, email, DNS/domain, payments, or paid AI/API calls were added
- Hosted Supabase migration has not been applied yet
- Hosted M7 smoke test has not been performed
- M7 production behavior has not been validated
- M7 must not be considered complete until the hosted migration is approved, applied, and tested

Next resume steps:

1. Inspect `git status` and `git log`
2. Review the M7 checkpoint
3. Run Supabase migration dry-run
4. Obtain human approval before applying the migration
5. Apply migration only after approval
6. Validate hosted schema and RLS
7. Perform one controlled M7 preview smoke test
8. Validate tracking, revocation, and security
9. Then lock/deploy M7
10. Do not begin M8 until M7 is complete

After approval, apply the migration with:

```bash
npx supabase db push --dry-run
npx supabase db push --yes
```

M8 must connect outreach emails to unique tracked preview links so SiteForge can measure the funnel:

sent -> delivered -> opened (low-confidence) -> preview clicked/viewed -> return visit -> CTA interaction -> replied -> interested -> customer

Preview analytics should continue to support approximate location, approximate visitors/repeat visits, likely-human vs likely-bot/scanner activity, and attribution to the outreach link. Do not store raw IP addresses long term.

## Milestone 6 Summary

- Deterministic/manual Builder
- $0 build path
- No xAI required
- Template-first architecture
- `WebsiteSpec` structured trusted data
- No arbitrary executable JSX/JS/HTML
- Allowlisted templates: `home-services-modern`, `restaurant-modern`, `professional-services-modern`
- Factual integrity and provenance
- Provenance states: `sourced`, `derived`, `placeholder`, `omitted`
- Auditor findings mapped to Builder fixes
- Trusted renderer validates persisted specs before rendering
- Internal authenticated preview only
- No public prospect preview yet
- Insert-only generated website history
- Monotonic `audited` to `website_built` progression
- `agent_runs` / `agent_tool_calls` audit trail
- Migration `20260829230000_builder_generated_websites.sql` applied remotely
- Authenticated Builder smoke test completed

Builder smoke artifact:

- Lead: `ee0aa3e0-78f9-478a-bdba-f5db6e7db1d3` / Atlantic Drain Plumbing
- Source audit: `d1c6b82e-2d85-43b1-952c-ccd32affc4a9`
- Builder run: `f831dfde-9312-422c-be3d-a2f4ad15f34c`
- Generated website: `29ca4d70-a474-44d0-8470-347adba511bc`
- Template: `home-services-modern`
- Build version: `builder.v1`
- `production_url`: `null`

Validation:

- `WebsiteSpec` passed trusted validation
- Factual-integrity verification passed
- Internal preview verified
- Preview remains behind admin auth
- 124 tests passed
- Zero paid AI/API calls
- Zero external monetary cost

## Current Safety State

- `XAI_ALLOW_LIVE_INFERENCE` remains disabled
- Scout deterministic path remains $0
- Auditor deterministic path remains $0
- Builder deterministic path remains $0
- Public prospect previews exist only after human approval and only as tokenized previews
- No email
- No payments
- No domain/DNS automation
- Supabase public application-table access remains revoked

## Next Milestone

Milestone 8: Sales Agent + email approval. Do not start it unless explicitly asked.
